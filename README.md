# optimizedratio

This is a simple simulation program to optimize randomization ratio that maximizes trial profit. 

The file "optimise_vary_n_fixed_budget.R" is the master file that runs the simulation. It calls "Psuccess.R" which has the function that calculates probability of success and and "profit_fun_wbudget.R" which has the function that calculates profit.
