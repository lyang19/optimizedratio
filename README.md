# optimizedratio

This is a simple simulation program to optimize randomization ratio that maximizes trial profit. 

The R script has 2 functions, P_success and profit. The P_success function calculates the probability of success and the profit function calculates the profit, both are functions of treatment efficacy (survival) priors, trial sample size, randomization ratio, cost and revenue. The profit function is to be optimized to find the randomization ratio that yields the highest profit given other constraints (such as budget and minimal probability of success). The program demonstrates an example of simulations on the change in optimized randomization ratios based on varying sample sizes.
